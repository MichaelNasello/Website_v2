                <p style = "font-size: 18px">
                    I am an individual with a passion for learning. To me, nothing
                    is more exciting than struggling through a problem and finding that breakthrough
                    solution. While studying Mechatronics Engineering at the
                    University of Waterloo, I have been presented with countless
                    opportunities to do so. Collaborations with classmates has led
                    to my introduction to several interesting areas, including Web
                    Development, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Outside
                    of the classroom, I use my time to develop skills in these areas.
                    Machine Learning is a field in which I have spent a significant amount
                    of time. From watching video lectures, reading articles, and
                    learning the mathematics behind model training,
                    I have become competent in the area and an active practitioner.

                    When I'm not in class nor working on a side project, I enjoy going to
                    the gym, going on runs, and playing several sports recreationally
                    (golf, tennis, soccer).

                <p>
                    I am currently working on a project that attempts to forecast sea-ice presence in several
                    large Canadian bodies of water, including Baffin Bay, Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes, the Northwest Territories,
                    and the Arctic. The model incorporates ConvLSTM's and the SIF-Net RNN architecture. It takes as input
                    bitmaps of several environmental conditions (current sea-ice presence, temperature, wind speed, etc.),
                    and outputs predictions for sea-ice presence.

                    <br><br>

                    I am currently developing the production aspect of the project. This involves adding to the current
                    data pipeline and API so that an end-user can simply provide input and receive a forecast of given length.

                    <br><br>

                    I have completed a Work Term Report, summarizing my work at the NRC. This report can be accessed

                <h4>Machine Vision Support Engineer</h4>
                <p>Vista Solutions Inc. <i> - Windsor, ON</i></p>
                <p>
                    As a Machine Vision Support Engineer at Vista, I was responsible for developing Machine Learning
                    solutions for projects where traditional methods of Machine Vision could not perform at the
                    level required by the client. I worked on several projects during my co-op. I spent most of my time
                    carrying an Object Detection project to completion.

                    <br><br>

                    I was also responsible for training Vista Engineers and providing an introduction
                    to Neural Networks. I delivered a webinar presentation that introduced general structure of
                    Neural Networks, the mathematics behind model training, and how these concepts can be implemented
                    into their custom applications.

                    <br><br>

                    I on-boarded Vista Employees with my work, prior to my departure, and trained the incoming co-op
                    student. I was requested for continual support related to Vista's Machine Learning projects.

                <p>
                    Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that involves the development of
                    algorithms and data architectures that gives a computer program the power to 'learn' from
                    data and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming. The training process
                    involves the input of data to the model. For a specific instance of input, the model's
                    output is compared to what the output should be. Using vector calculus, the internal parameters
                    of the model are adjusted so that the model's output approaches the desired result.
                    This process of training is repeated until the developer is pleased with the performance of their
                    Machine Learning model.

                            segmentation to draw a mask over the bodies, and calculate the locations of their

                            <h3>Problem</h3>

                            The goal of this project was to develop a policy the CartPole can follow so that it stands upright. At each
                            time step, OpenAI Gym provides the cart's position, angle, velocity, and angular velocity. It is our
                            job to use this information to determine what action should be taken that will maximize the
                            probability that the CartPole remains standing upright. Possible actions are moving left or right.

                            <h3>Approach</h3>

                            <p>
                                Reinforcement Learning was used to solve this problem. This concept is synonymous to
                                positive/negative reinforcements in real life:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>If a dog behaves, they receive a treat; if they misbehave, you put them in their cage.
                                     After time, the dog figures out what is considered good/bad behaviour
                                    based off of the consequences.
                                </i>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This approach can be used to our advantage when training AI. The reinforcement learning application
                                consists of four entities:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The environment (OpenAI Gym / Your house)</li>
                                <li>The agent (CartPole / The dog)</li>
                                <li>The action space (Move left or right / Behave or misbehave)</li>
                                <li>The reward (Number / Give treat or put in cage)</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>
                                The approach for solving this problem is the following: train the CartPole to take actions that
                                maximize its reward.
                            </p>

                            <h4>How is the network trained?</h4>

                            <p>
                                For a given state, it is the network's job to output a vector of probabilities for taking each
                                action in the action space. When training, we attempt to minimize the difference between that output
                                and the action that maximizes rewards.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For example, if the CartPole is currently travelling to the left, it is preferable to
                                reverse that movement and begin travelling to the right. Thus, a desired output from the model is [0, 1]
                                ([Going left, Going right]). A network without training won't necessarily generate that output.
                                The optimizer's job is to adjust the network so that the vector approaches [0, 1] when the CartPole
                                is moving left.
                            </p>

                            <h4>So our loss function attempts to minimize that difference. How are rewards used?</h4>

                            <p>
                                We multiply our gradients by the rewards. When performing Back Propagation, positive rewards
                                (agent did something right) will cause the optimizer to descend down the gradient. The
                                opposite is true for negative rewards (agent did something wrong). This process has the effect of
                                'learning' what the appropriate actions to take are, given a state from the environment.
                            </p>
                            <h4>The Credit Assignment Problem</h4>

                            <p>
                                There is a fundamental problem with how rewards are calculated: how does the agent know if
                                falling at t = 100 was caused by an action at t = 98 or t = 17? This is known as the 'Credit
                                Assignment Problem'.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To solve this problem, we apply a discount rate to our rewards. For each time step:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>
                                    Discounted Reward [t = t] = Reward [t = t] * pow(discount_rate, 0) + ... + Reward [t = t + n]
                                    * pow(discount_rate, n)
                                </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note: discount_rate belongs to (0, 1)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What does this accomplish? This decreases the impact that a future reward has on the current time
                                step. Using discounted rewards, the agent, over many games, is able to 'learn' what actions,
                                given a corresponding input from the environment, are beneficial.
                            </p>

                                The tf.keras API was leveraged for the formulation of models. Each model architecture developed
                                consisted of a series of fully-connected layers. Dropout was used for the final design; this
                                design performed the best during testing.

                                After 5 iterations of the model architecture, a policy model was trained that converged and
                                was able to survive in the environment. The program was manually
                                stopped at 15,000 steps (about 5 minutes). It took 900 episodes of training to reach this point.
                                Below is a video showing the agent's progress throughout the training loop.

                            <h3>Problem</h3>

                            The goal is to correctly classify a single handwritten digit given an arbitrary image.
                            To test out the performance of my model, you can draw a number in the canvas below. To make
                            a prediction, an image of your drawing will be saved and pushed through the model. When your
                            done, hit <b>Clear</b> to retry.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div id="paint">
                                <canvas id="myCanvas" style = "border:1px solid #000000; background-color: white"></canvas>
                            </div>

                            <div id="predicted">
                                <div id="number"></div>
                                <br>

                            </div>

                            <h3>Approach</h3>

                            <div class = "row" style = "padding: 5px; padding-left: 10px">

                                        Machine Learning was used to solve this problem. Using the tf.keras API, a Convolutional
                                        Neural Network was trained on the MNIST dataset. The following model architecture was
                                        used.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Thanks to Google, I was able to train on a state-of-the-art TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)
                                        through their free cloud service: Google Colab. On the MNIST dataset, I reached a
                                        validation accuracy of approximately 99.2%.

                                        <br>

                                        It is important to note that the
                                        numbers of the MNIST dataset are written in pen, while we are using an HTML
                                        canvas to draw our numbers; this could slightly impact model performance.
