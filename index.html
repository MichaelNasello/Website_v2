                    I am an individual with a passion for learning. To me, nothing
                    is more exciting than struggling through a problem and finding that breakthrough
                    solution. While studying Mechatronics Engineering at the
                    University of Waterloo, I have been presented with countless
                    opportunities to do so. Collaborations with classmates has led
                    to my introduction to several interesting areas, including Web
                    Development, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, etc. Outside
                    of the classroom, I use my time to develop skills in these areas.
                    Machine Learning is a field in which I have spent a significant amount
                    of time. From watching video lectures, reading articles, and
                    learning the mathematics behind model training,
                    I have become competent in the area and an active practitioner.

                    (golf, tennis, soccer).

                    I am currently working on a project that attempts to forecast sea-ice presence in several
                    large Canadian bodies of water, including Baffin Bay, Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes, the Northwest Territories,
                    and the Arctic. The model incorporates ConvLSTM's and the SIF-Net RNN architecture. It takes as input
                    bitmaps of several environmental conditions (current sea-ice presence, temperature, windspeed, etc.),
                    and outputs predictions for sea-ice presence.

                    <br><br>
                    I am currently developing the production aspect of the project. This involves adding to the current
                    data pipeline and API so that an end-user can simply provide input and receive a forecast of given length.

                <p>
                    As a Machine Vision Support Engineer at Vista, I was responsible for developing Machine Learning
                    solutions for projects where traditional methods of Machine Vision could not perform at the
                    level required by the client. I worked on several projects during my co-op. I spent most of my time
                    carrying an Object Detection project to completion.
                    <br><br>

                    I was also responsible for training Vista Engineers and providing an introduction
                    to Neural Networks. I delivered a webinar presentation that introduced general structure of
                    Neural Networks, the mathematics behind model training, and how these concepts can be implemented
                    into their custom applications.

                    <br><br>
                    I on-boarded Vista Employees with my work, prior to my departure, and trained the incoming co-op
                    student. I was requested for continual support related to Vista's Machine Learning projects.

                <p>
                    Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that involves the development of
                    algorithms and data architectures that gives a computer program the power to 'learn' from
                    data and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming. The training process
                    involves the input of data to the model. For a specific instance of input, the model's
                    output is compared to what the output should be. Using vector calculus, the internal parameters
                    of the model are adjusted so that the model's output approaches the desired result.
                    This process of training is repeated until the developer is pleased with the performance of their
                    Machine Learning model.

                            I developed a webpage written in virtually only HTML and CSS. No framework was
                            used to help with the design of the page.

                            This was a first-year, first-term design project for all Mechatronics
                            Engineering students at the University of Waterloo. It was an open-ended
                            project. We were given a lego set and an EV3 controller. Monitoring/defending
                            personal space was the task we choose. The final product surveyed an area and
                            fired projectiles at approaching objects.
                            Chassis composed of lego; source code written in RobotC.
                            During the closing phase of the project, we produced a final report that
                            summarized project scope, constraints and criteria, mechanical and software
                            design and methods of testing.
